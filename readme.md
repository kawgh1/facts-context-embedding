### Adding Context with Embedding Techniques

- In this project we will explore using an existing document -- it could be a .txt file, a PDF, a CSV file, a financial report, anything -- and enabling ChatGPT to draw data from this file to return information about the file to the user.
- This example is a short 10 lines of random facts in a .txt file, but the same principle would apply to any business report or book in a PDF form.
